## Caesar Cipher Frequency Analysis
University extra credit assignment focused on breaking a Caesar cipher using
frequency analysis.

The project analyzes letter frequency distributions of encrypted text and
compares them with expected English letter frequencies to determine the most
likely shift.

### Concepts used
- Frequency analysis
- Chi-squared distance
- Cosine similarity
- Basic cryptography concepts

This project was implemented as part of an Object-Oriented Programming course.
